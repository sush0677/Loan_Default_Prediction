### Predictive Analysis for Kiya.AI

## Project Description
This project involved developing a predictive analysis model for **Kiya.AI**, focusing on forecasting trends based on historical and synthetic data. The goal was to provide actionable insights by analyzing patterns and predicting outcomes relevant to the financial and business sectors.

To test and validate the model, a synthetic dataset was generated, ranging from 50,000 to 150,000 samples. The dataset contained relevant features mimicking real-world financial data, allowing for robust testing and prediction.

## Key Contributions:
- **Data Generation**: Created a synthetic dataset containing 50,000 to 150,000 samples for training and testing predictive models. The data was structured to simulate real-world financial scenarios.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed both real and synthetic data for analysis. This included handling missing data, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA to uncover patterns and correlations within the data.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implemented machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to predict financial outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated models using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R². Selected the best-performing model based on predictive accuracy and efficiency.
- **Deployment**: Integrated the final model into Kiya.AI’s infrastructure to deliver real-time predictions, optimizing business decision-making processes.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for programming.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data generation and manipulation.
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizing data insights and model performance.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for development and presentation.
